# Simple CRUD on FlightPHP (SQLite)
Goal: minimal project with a model, SQL migration, REST API and a plain HTML page (no CSS).
## Run (Docker Compose)
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. In project root:
docker compose down --remove-orphans
docker compose build
3. Run migration (creates DB file and table):
```


docker compose exec flight php vendor/bin/runway db:migrate


```

4. Open in browser:

- API: http://localhost:8080/entities


- UI:  http://localhost:8080/items
Run without Docker (needs PHP):

```
php -S localhost:8080 -t public


php vendor/bin/runway db:migrate
## Database



- SQLite file: `app/database.sqlite`


- Migrations: `migrations/001_create_items.sql`


- Table: `items (id, name, quantity, note, created_at, updated_at)`
## REST API



- GET /entities — list (200)


- GET /entities/{id} — detail (200, 404)


- POST /entities — create (201, 400)


- PUT /entities/{id} — update (200, 400, 404)


- DELETE /entities/{id} — delete (204, 404)
Validation:



- name: required, length ≤ 100


- quantity: number ≥ 0


- note: length ≤ 1000
Errors: returns JSON with `errors` or `error` and proper code (400/404).
